> "Allows millions of user to rent a integer on the web to create small application that need communication without requesting heavy server knowledge. Owner of integer can play the game of the studio that only require a integer to play to it."

Pitch of the Integer Games concept.

- I want to be able to managed bots on several computer with a precised timing but to do that I need a server to communicte between those bots.
- Have a web server or website cost a lot and it Geeky/Nerdy.

What if we create a mutulalized service that allows you to rent a integer. 
And a mutualized service that allows to store stackf of incoming integer change at precised UTC time.

That would allows thousans to millions of user to have a Iot project without having the difficulty of hosting.

"Did I said millions ?" Yes because if you can buy at low price a integer you will probably buy them by group.
A int.max integer array take around 8 Giga Bytes of ram data.

Meaning that on a computer with 64 Go of ram, I can run such server ("not considering friction")


If you want such service to run. You need to be prepare for DoS attack.
But also to limitation of the computer capability.

The idea here would be to create a game studio based on the integer hosting service in aim to stress test a 200 000 active players multiplayer game.
