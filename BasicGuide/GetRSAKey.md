# To Get a RSA Key ?

A RSA key is composed of a private and public key.

### Example: Generate a RSA Key
Using this tool to generate a key pair: https://cryptotools.net/rsagen 

```
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----

Don't lose or share your private key.  
It is the only system that allows us to be sure you are who you claim you are.  

The public key is what you will provide use to claim your integer.  


You can generate a random RSA Key here.  
Or any where ou want from language or online website.  

To be able to play the game.   
You need to subscribe to Tipeee or Twitch.  
Then chat to IntegerGames your public key by messages.  

This public key that can be share to any one.  
Will be attributed to a integer index.  

You can find the claim index here:

> ## Warning:   
> To avoid social hacking.  
> Any support request to the team will be check by a signed message using the public key linked to the integer.  
> No Exception.   
> <u>Don't lose your private key (^^' )</u>



# What about Ethereum and BitCoin key ?

We wanted to use Etereum key to interact with the server. But RSA is more used in all language that the Ethereum one. 
If you want to help us use public Ethereum key. Feel free to help us.  

I really love Ethereum principle. An option will be add in the server to set your Ethereum public key for games with prize money from the future sponsors. You need your RSA key to set the Ethereum key.

Sorry if it is a bit techy. We will provide tutorial and guide to learn what is all of that words your just read and did not understood ;)-
